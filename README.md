# Data Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

This is a minimal, from-scratch portfolio you can deploy for free on GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1. Rename the repository to `yourusername.github.io` (exact GitHub username).
2. Upload these files (or push via Git).
3. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io` after a minute or two.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` â€” name, bio, links, and project cards.
- Replace images in `/images` with your project screenshots.
- Optional: add your `resume.pdf` to the root and keep the header button.
